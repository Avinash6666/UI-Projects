JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

JavaScript Values:
*******************
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.

JavaScript Literals:
*******************
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

JavaScript Variables:
*********************
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6.

JavaScript Operators:
********************
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables

JavaScript Expressions:
**********************
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
The computation is called an evaluation.
For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50.
Expressions can also contain variable values (ex: x=5;)
    ex: document.getElementById().innerHtml = x*10;

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe"
