JSON Servers:
************
   -- A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
   -- When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.
   -- You can request JSON from the server by using an AJAX request
   -- As long as the response from the server is written in JSON format, you can parse the string into a JavaScript object.
   -- It is used to develop or creating the urls(rest api's)
         Ex:
        get,post,put,delete request...,
    -- JSON Server by default running on port number "3000"
    -- we will install JSOn Server by using following command
            >npm install -g json-server
    npm stands for node package manager
    -g stands for golbal installation
    we will loaded the data in JSON Server by using following command
    >json-server --watch data.json
    Test urls:
    ***********
    If you want to test the software we have one software
    We will test rest api's with one software "poostman Tool"
      http://localhost:3000/products

    if you want get the data then use get request
    if you want to add the data then use post request
    if you want to updated the data then use put request
    if you want to delete the data then use delete request
    if you want to arrange the un-order data properly then we will use one code http://localhost:3000/products?_sort=id
    if you want paticular data then we can call after url that paticular id http://localhost:3000/products/222
    if want filter the that you can do  http://localhost:3000/products?_cost=30000&id=444
    if you want  http://localhost:3000/products?_limit=3&_sort=cost&_order=des



JSONP:
**********
    JSONP is a method for sending JSON data without worrying about cross-domain issues.
    JSONP does not use the XMLHttpRequest object.
    JSONP uses the <script> tag instead.
    JSONP stands for JavaScript object Notation with Padding.
