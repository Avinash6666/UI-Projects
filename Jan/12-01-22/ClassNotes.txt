Difference b/w XML & JSON
***************************
    Both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server.
    XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. 
    JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

JSON is Like XML Because:
*************************

    Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
    Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
    Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest


JSON is Unlike XML Because:
**************************
    JSON doesn't use end tag
    JSON is shorter
    JSON is quicker to read and write
    JSON can use arrays


Valid Data Types:
****************
    In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:
        a string                            : It must be in " Double or a Single quotes "
        a number                            : It must be an " Integer or a Floating point "   
        an object (JSON object)             : Values in JSON can be objects. It is indicated as {we place here key{we place obj here}}
        an array                            : Values in JSON can be arrays. It is indicated as []
        a boolean                           : In boolean we place values ture/false
        null                                : In null the values is null
